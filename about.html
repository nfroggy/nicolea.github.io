<div id="info"><small>I'm Nicole, an Australian graphic designer and illustrator. <p>
Iâ€™m inspired by nature and the colours found within. A lover of the ocean and walks in new places, I try to design fluidly and capture a new point of view.
<p>
My experiences come from working full time at Pinstripe Creative, a small corporate design studio, as well as Rabbit Hole, University of Western Sydney's in-house design studio and MGroup Inc, a brand service agency and maker of Poster Magazine. 
<p>
I have become a designer who enjoys aesthetic appeal, handicraft, building awareness and delivering the message.
